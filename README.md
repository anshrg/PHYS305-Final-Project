# PHYS305-Final-Project
Final project for PHYS 305 - Computational Physics (University of Arizona) 

## Project Description:
The project report file **PHYS_305_Final_Project_Report.pdf** contains information about the procedure alongside analysis of the final results.

In this project, an RK4 numerical integration scheme is used to determine the magnetic field lines from two separate current sources. One source is a simple current loop and the second is a "magnetic bottle" consisting of four loops. Analytical equations for the magnetic field are supplied in the project instructions. Using the integraton scheme, the resulting field lines are determined. The convergence rate of the solution as a function of step size is determined. Moreover, using Richardson extrapolation for error correction, the determined error convergence rate is improved.
